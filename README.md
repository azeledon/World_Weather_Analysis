## Overview

Perform statistical calculations using linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres to predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. Subsequently, export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria, and then map these cities using GeoViews and the Geoapify API.
